I decided to study software engineering because I have always had a love for computer and understanding how things work. Even at a young age I was always facinated with software. I would pretend to write software programs on my apple 2E computer. When the internet first came out in thbe 90's and I was maybe 11 years old, I made my own website. Granted it was mostly images, that would take forever to load on dial up internet. But I was super proud of it.
